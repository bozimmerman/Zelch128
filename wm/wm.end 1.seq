"Ÿ     ÙOU ENTER THE TRAINING HALL AND ARE USHERED DIRECTLY INTO THE CHAMBER"OF THE COUNCIL.  ÙOU REVERENTLY TAKE OUT THE THE PIECES OF THE ÓTAFF OF ËALAS "AND LAY THEM ON THE TABLE.  ÁS ONE, THE COUNCIL STANDS UP AND BOWS TO YOU.  "'ÂRAVE ×ARRIOR, YOU HAVE DONE MORE THAT WE COULD HAVE POSSIBLE HOPED FOR."×ITH YOUR EFFORT, THE ×REAKER WILL ONCE AGAIN BE IMPRISONED.'  ×ITH THOSE "WORDS, ALL OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERS GATHER IN A CIRCLE AROUND THE STAFF AND "START CONCENTRATING.  ÃURIOUS, YOU STAY AND WATCH.  ÔHE LEADER STOOPS AND "PICKS UP THE PIECES, AND AS HE PUTS EACH END TO ANOTHER END, IT CLICKS SOFTLY "INTO PLACE, AND EMITS A BEAM OF LIGHT.  " "     ÁS THE LAST PIECE CLICKS INTO PLACE, THERE IS A TREMENDOUS FLASH OF RED "LIGHT, AND ONE OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERS SCREAMS FROM THE EFFORT AND COLLAPSES.  "ÔHE OTHERS QUICKLY MOVE AND COMPENSATE FOR HIS LOSS.  ÔHEY START CHANTING AS "THE LEADER RAISES THE STAFF ABOVE HIS HEAD AND COMMANDS:  'ÂEEZLEÂUBBA- FOE OF "ANCIENT TIMES!  É COMMAND THEE BY THE POWER OF THE ÓTAFF OF ËALAS, TO COME "FORTH AND SHOW YOURSELF!'  Á REDDISH HAZE STARTS TO FORM IN THE AIR ABOVE "THEM." "     ×HAT EVENTUALLY FORMS IS A RED BALL IMPRISONING A HIDEOUS LOOKING "HUMANOID, EXCEPT THAT IT HAS VERY ROUGH SKIN, AND ITS EYES ARE RED.  ÉT IS "ALSO VERY HEAVILY MUSCLED.  ÔHIS MUST BE ÂEEZLEÂUBBA.  ÔHE LEADER SPEAKS, "'×ITH THE POWER OF THE ÓTAFF AT THIS COUNCIL'S DISPOSAL, É WILL ONCE AGAIN "RENEW YOUR IMPRISONMENT!  ÙOU WILL BE AS YOU HAVE BEEN, ETERNALLY BANISHED AND "IMPOTENT!  ÆURTHER MORE-'  " "     ÂEEZLEÂUBBA CUTS HIM OFF WITH EARTH SHAKING LAUGHTER.  'ÆOOLISH MORTAL!  "×HAT DO YOU KNOW OF ETERNITY?  É HAVE SEEN THE BEGINNING OF TIME, AND WILL "LIVE TO SEE THE END!  ÙOU PETTY LIVES ARE LIKE THE LIVES OF FIREFLIES TO ME - "YOU BURN BRIGHTLY FOR A VERY SHORT TIME, BUT THEN YOU BURN OUT AND NOBODY "REMEMBERS YOU.  ÙOU HAVE ALL PLAYED DIRECTLY INTO MY HANDS, EVEN THOUGH YOU "KNEW IT NOT, YOU THINK THAT YOU LIVE BY YOUR OWN FREE WILL.  ÈAH!  ÙOUR RACE "IS SO EASY TO MANIPULATE!  ×ATCH!'" "     'ÙOU WILL BURN IN ÈELL!!!!', THE LEADER SCREAMS ANGRILY, 'YOU ARE THE "SPAWN OF MAGGOTS, AND THAT IS WHAT YOU SERVE!  É, IN THE NAME OF ËAL-"" "    'ÓILENCE!!', THUNDERS ÂEEZLEÂUBBA, SHAKING THE GROUND, AND INTERRUPTING"THE LEADER.  ÈE TURNS TO YOU, 'ÙOU ARE MOST BRAVE, AND FOOLISH, BUT YET YOU "MAY BE SHAPED...'  ÈE QUICKLY TURNS WITHIN HIS BALL, AND POINTS AT ONE OF THE "COUNCIL MEMBERS.  'ÎOW, SERVE YOUR MASTER!'" "    ÔHE COUNCIL MEMBER TAKES OUT A SMALL NEEDLE AND BOUNDS OVER TO THE LEADER, "AND BEFORE HE CAN REACT, STABS HIM.  ÈE FALLS TO THE GROUND, AND CONVULSES FOR "A FEW SECONDS BEFORE PASSING INTO THE REALM BEYOND.  ÔHE OTHER MEMBER STAND "BACK IN FEAR OF THIS NEW-FOUND TRAITOR, AND SOME BREAK FOR THE DOOR, TRYING TO "ESCAPE HIM.  ÈE SMILES AND PICKS UP THE ÓTAFF AND CRIES 'ÒEMEMBER ME ÍASTER!'. "×ITH THAT, HE SNAPS THE ÓTAFF." "     ÔHE BALL OF FORCE SURROUNDING ÂEEZLEÂUBBA SHREDS INTO MIST, AND HE "THUNDERS TO THE GROUND.  ÑUICKLY HE TURNS TO THE COUNCIL MEMBER WHO FREED HIM. "'ÔRAITORS ARE ONLY GOOD WHILE YOU NEED THEM!  ÙOU ARE WEAK AND GREEDY, NOT "SOMEONE WHO IS EVEN WORTH TO BURN SHORTLY.'  ÈE TAKES THE MANS HEAD AND "CRUSHES IT LIKE A GRAPE.  ÂLOOD AND BRAINS SPLATTER THE WALLS, AND SERVE TO "TERRIFY THE COUNCIL MEMBERS EVEN MORE.  ÙOU THEN NOTICE THAT THE TWO PIECES OF "THE ÓTAFF HAVE FALLEN NEAR TO YOU.  ÙOU DASH OVER AND PICK THEM UP.  ÙOU "ATTEMPT TO PUT THEM TOGERHER, BUT GET ONLY A SPARK, AND NO CLICK.  ÂEEZLEÂUBBA"SNAPS AROUND AND SEES YOU ATTEMPTING TO PUT THE STAFF TOGERHER.  'ÙOU DON'T"HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE OR THE POWER TO DO WHAT YOU ARE ATTEMPTING!  ÈOWEVER, "É RESPECT YOUR COURAGE AND INTEGRITY IN SPITE OF OVERWHELMING ODDS.  ÕNLIKE "THESE COWARDS CROUNCHING IN THE CORNERS, YOU AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO SAVE WHAT YOU "YOU CARE ABOUT.  ÂECUASE OF THAT, É WILL MAKE YOU AN OFFER.  ÈAND ME THE ÓTAFF "AND É WILL BESTOW UPON YOU THE POWER OF ÉMMORTALITY, YOU WILL LIVE WITH ME AS "MY DISCIPLE FOR ETERNITY, LEARNING THE PLEASURE OF TORTURE, AND THE POWER OF "INTIMIDATION.  ÉF YOU REFUSE, THEN É WILL GIVE YOU A NOBLE DEATH, KILLED WITH "YOUR OWN SWORD.  ÔHE GREATEST HONOR A TRUE WARRIOR CAN HAVE.  ×HAT DO YOU "CHOOSE?'
