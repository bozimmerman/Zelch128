"     ÙOU ENTER THE INNER CHAMBER AND STAND BEFORE A SEMI-CIRCULAR TABLE WITH"TEN MEN SEATED.  ÔHE ONE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOU STANDS UP AND ADDRESSES YOU."                                                                              "     'ÂRAVE ×ARRIOR, THE COUNCIL HAS DETERMINED THAT WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR, THE"      OLD DEMON OF LEGEND, ÂEEZLEÂUBBA, WILL BE LOOSED FROM HIS PRISON TO ONCE"      AGAIN WREAK HAVOC ON OUR WORLD.  ÈE HAS BEEN IMPRISONED FOR THE LAST "      1500 YEARS, AND MANY HAVE FORGOTTEN OF HIM AND OF THE ÓTAFF OF ËALAS."      ÔHE ÓTAFF OF ËALAS WAS THE MAIN INSTRUMENT IN MAKING HIS IMPRISONMENT "      POSSIBLE.  ÔHE ÓTAFF OF ËALAS HAS BEEN HELD IN A MONASTERY IN A NORTHERN "      PROVINCE AS A HOLY RELIC OF A TIME GONE BY.  ÔHREE WEEKS AGO, WE GOT"      INFORMATION THAT THE ÓTAFF WAS STOLEN BY THE ANCIENT CULT, AND THE CULT"      IS NOW TRYING TO AWAKEN ÂEEZLEÂUBBA, AND BY ALL REPORTS, COMING ALONG"      QUITE WELL.  ÔHE ONLY WAY TO DEFEAT THE CULT AND TO KEEP ÂEEZLEÂUBBA IN "      PRISON IS TO USE THE STAFF TO RENEW THE ETHEREAL PRISON THAT HAS KEPT "      HIM.  ÕNFORTUNATELY, THE CULT KNEW THIS, AND BROKE THE STAFF UP INTO 10"      PIECES AND HID THEM IN THEIR DUNGEONS.  ÁS YOU ATTAIN EACH LEVEL, WE"      WILL TELEPORT YOU TO THE APPROPRIATE DUNGEON AND HOPEFULLY YOU WILL BE "      ABLE TO RECOVER THE PIECES OF THE STAFF AND KEEP YOUR LIFE.'"
