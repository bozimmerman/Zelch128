     ÇALACTIC ÅMPIRE V2.0      (C)1991 ÅLITE ÓOFTWARE        ÂY: ÂO ÚIMMERMAN     ÇALACTIC ÅMPIRE IS A STRATEGY MULTI-PLAYER ONLINE GAME WRITTEN TO RUN ON ÚELCH 128 ÂULLETIN ÂOARD SYSTEMS USING THE ‡ONLINE BASIC‡ ENVIRONMENT.  ÔHE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS QUITE SIMPLE: TAKE OVER ALL OF THE PLANETS IN THE GAME'S ‡GALAXY‡ AS PART OF YOUR EMPIRE.  ÐART É:  ÏF GALAXIES AND PLANETS     ÇALACTIC ÅMPIRE IS PLAYED ON A GRID OF TWENTY-FIVE PLANETS.  ÅACH PLANET APPEARS ON THE GRID AS TWO CHARACTERS, THE FIRST BEING THE LOCATION.  ÔHE FIRST CHARACTER FOR EACH PLANET IS EITHER A ‡0‡ FOR AN INDEPENDENT PLANET OR AN UPPERCASE LETTER FROM ‡Á‡ TO ‡Ê‡ REPRESENTING THAT PLANET'S EMPIRICAL LOYALTY.  ÔHE SECOND CHARACTER IS AN IDENTIFICATION LETTER USED WHEN ACCESSING THAT PLANET.  ÅACH WORLD WILL FALL INTO ONE OF THREE CATEGORIES:   ÉNDEPENDENT - THESE PLANETS BELONG TO NO EMPIRES, CAN BE THE OBJECT OF ATTACKS BUT NOT TREATIES, AND ARE CONTROLLED BY THE COMPUTER DURING PLAY.ÐLANETS OF YOUR EMPIRE - THEY HAVE THE UPPERCASE LETTER IDENTIFYING YOUR EMPIRE BESIDE THEM AND ARE DIRECTLY ACCESSIBLE BY YOU.  ÙOU MAY REMOVE OR MANIPULATE SHIPS ON THESE PLANETS IN ANY WAY, AND YOU MAY GET THE STATS ON THESE PLANETS AT ANY TIME.ÐLANETS OF OTHER EMPIRES - THESE ARE YOUR AGGRESSIVE ENEMIES; THEY MAY BE THE OBJECTS OF TREATIES OR ATTACKS.     ÙOU WILL JUDGE THE WORLDS OF YOUR EMPIRE BY THEIR POWER AS ATTACKING AND SHIP-PRODUCING ENTITIES.  ÅACH PLANET CAN HOLD ANY NUMBER OF SHIPS AND HAS THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE MORE SHIPS EVERY YEAR; ALL UNDER CONTROL OF THE EMPIRICAL WARLORD.  ÁS YOU EXPAND AND CONQUER AWAY FROM YOUR HOME WORLD YOU NEED TO KEEP ONE QUIRK OF GALACTIC OVERLORDSHIP IN MIND:  THE INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT.  ÔHE MORE PLANETS YOU HAVE IN YOUR EMPIRE THE BETTER THE CHANCE THAT ONE OF THEM WILL DECIDE TO DECLARE ITS INDEPENDENCE.  ÙOUR HOME PLANET IS OF COURSE IMMUNE TO THIS, BUT THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT YOUR ACQUISITIONS FROM THIS PHENOMENON IS TO HAVE A SUFFICIENT MILITARY PRESENCE (AT LEAST 1000 SHIPS).ÐART ÉÉ:  ÍATTERS OF PLAY     ÇALACTIC ÅMPIRE ALLOWS A PLAYER ONE ‡GAME‡ PER DAY.  ÅACH GAME CONSISTS OF 10 YEARS WHICH ARE USED UP WHENEVER THE PLAYER HITS RETURN AND ADVANCES THE CLOCK.  ÅACH YEAR A PLAYER MAY LAUNCH AS MANY MISSIONS AS ALLOWED BY THE SYSTEM, THOUGH THE MISSIONS WILL NOT ARRIVE AT THEIR DESTINATIONS WITHOUT A LITTLE TRAVEL TIME.  ÉF YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH YEARS REMAINING TO COMPLETE A MISSION OF GREAT DISTANCE, OR THE PLANETS INVOLVED IN A MISSION ARE JUST TOO FAR AWAY FROM EACH OTHER, THE SYSTEM WILL NOTIFY YOU OF WHAT YOU MAY NOT DO.     ÎEW EMPERORS WILL BE SELDOM SEEN IN AN INVOLVED GAME OF ÇALACTIC ÅMPIRE.  ÏNLY TEN EMPERORS ARE ALLOWED TO EXIST WITHIN THE PLAYING FIELD, AND A NEW EMPEROR WILL ONLY BE ALLOWED TO PLAY IF THERE IS A FREE INDEPENDENT PLANET AVAILABLE FOR USE.  ÐART ÉÉÉ:  ÔHE PASSIVE MISSION     ÔHE FIRST MISSION WE'LL TALK ABOUT IS ALSO THE ONE USED MOST OFTEN:  SCOUTING.  ÔHIS PARTICULAR MISSION INVOLVES SENDING A RELATIVELY SMALL FLEET OF SHIPS, WITH THE PURPOSE OF SPYING ON A PARTICULAR PLANET AND REPORTING BACK THAT PLANET'S STORE OF SHIPS WITH THEIR YEARLY PRODUCTION RATE.  ÔHIS SPY FLEET MUST BE AT LEAST 20 SHIPS, AND RARELY IS ANY MORE THAN THAT NEEDED (UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO PENETRATE A DEFENSIVE PATROL).  ÔHESE MISSIONS CAN BE TURNED BACK FROM THEIR ORIGIN BY CONTAINMENT PATROLS, AND CAN BE GIVEN A LOT OF TROUBLE IN COMPLETINGTHEIR TASKS IF THEY RUN INTO DEFENSIVE PATROLS.  ÓCOUTS ARE ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE TO DISCOVERY BY ENEMY AUTHORITIES, WHICH CAN ABORT THE MISSION.       ÁNOTHER INTELLIGENCE GATHERING MISSION IS THE INTELLIGENCE NETWORK.  ×ITH THIS COMMAND YOU CAN SETUP AN ENTIRE NETWORK OF SPIES WHO STAY PERMANENTLY ON EVERY PLANET OF A ENEMY EMPIRE, WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS TO REPORT BACK TO THEIR OWN EMPIRE.  ÔO SETUP AN INTELLIGENCE NETWORK 2000 SHIPS MUST BE SENT JUST TO INFILTRATE THE ENEMY GOVERNMENT.  ÉN ADDITION TO THOSE SHIPS, A PLAYER MUST SEND 200 SHIPS FOR EVERY PLANET IN THE ENEMY EMPIRE TO ENSURE ACCURACY IN THE REPORTS.       ÒEPORTS FOR INTELLIGENCE NETWORKS ARE FILED ALONG WITH THE TRANSMISSIONS OF THE SOURCE EMPIRE.  ×HEN VIEWING TRANSMISSIONS THE PLAYER WITH AN INTELLIGENCE NETWORK CAN ALSO VIEW THE VITAL STATISTICS ON ALL PLANETS IN AN INFILTRATED EMPIRE.     ÔHE LAST KIND OF PASSIVE MISSION IS THE REINFORCEMENT/EQUIP MISSION.  ÕSUALLY THIS INVOLVES A TACTICAL MOVE WHERE A PLANET IN AN EMPIRE SENDS SOME OR ALL OF THEIR SHIPS TO ANOTHER PLANET FOR THE PURPOSE OF BETTER PROTECTION, OR GROUPING FOR A MAJOR OFFENSIVE.  ÓOMETIMES THOUGH YOU MAY WANT TO REINFORCE AN ALLY.ÐART ÉÖ:  ÔHE TACTICAL AND DEFENSIVE MISSION      ÏF ALL THE TACTICAL/DEFENSIVE MISSIONS, THE PATROL IS THE MOST COMPLEX.  ÉT INVOLVES THE LAUNCHING OF A NUMBER OF SHIPS FROM ONE PLANET TO THE OTHER WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO EITHER PROTECT THE RECEIVING PLANET,CONTAIN (OR CAUSE TROUBLE) FOR THE PLANET, OR RID THE PLANET OF OTHER PATROLS.     ÔHE FIRST TYPE OF PATROL IS THE DEFENSIVE PATROL.  ÉT'S PURPOSE IS SELF EXPLANATORY: TO PROTECT A PLANET FROM ALL KINDS OF ATTACKS OR AGGRESSIVE MANEUVERS.  ÄEPENDING ON THE SIZE OF THE PATROL IT CAN TURN BACK ENEMY SCOUTING AND INTELLIGENCE MISSIONS, ENEMY PATROLS, AND CLIP GREAT NUMBERS FROM AN ENEMY ATTACKER.     ÔHE SECOND TYPE OF PATROL IS THE CONTAINMENT PATROL.  ÔHESE SERVE AN ALL-PURPOSE ENEMY TROUBLE CAUSING MECHANISM.  ÔHEY PREVENT ALL MANNER OF MISSIONS FROM EVER LEAVING A PLANETS SURFACE, AND EVEN PREVENT REINFORCEMENTS AND OTHER FRIENDLY ENCOUNTERS FROM EVER REACHING THE PLANET.  ÔHE CONTAINMENT AND THE DEFENSIVE PATROL SHARE TWO THINGS IN COMMON:  THEY CAN BOTH BE REMOVED BY ATTACKING FLEETS, AND THEY ARE BOTH VULNERABLE TO THE ATTACKS OF THE THIRD TYPE OF PATROL- THE ÁNTI-ÐATROL.     ÔHE HUMAN FACTOR ENTERS ÇALACTIC ÅMPIRE THROUGH THE ÔREATY AND THE ÔRANSMISSION.  ÔHE TREATY IS A MISSION WHERE A PLANET TRADES A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SHIPS FOR THE PROMISE OF NON-AGGRESSION FROM THE RECEIVING PLANET.  ÔHIS PLANET MAY OR MAY NOT ACCEPT THE GIFT OF SHIPS, BUT IF THEY DO, THEY WILL BE BOUND BY THE COMPUTER TO HONOR THE NON-AGGRESSION PACT.  Á PLANET THAT SENDS THE SHIPS AND RECEIVES THE TREATY IS NOT BOUND BY ANY PROMISE.  ÉT'S POSSIBLE FOR A PLANET TO SEND A FEW TREATY SHIPS TO ANOTHER WORLD, GET THEM ACCEPTED, AND BE PROTECTED FROM ATTACK, YET THEY MAY STILL ATTACK THEMSELVES.     ÔREATIES (WHEN MISUNDERSTOOD) CAN BE A POWERFUL TOOL IN THE HANDS OF SMALL EMPIRES, WHEN PROTECTING THEMSELVES FROM THE LARGER EMPIRES.  ÌIKE ALL PROMISES HOWEVER, TREATIES MAY BE BROKEN BY SENDING THE TREATY GIFT OF VESSELS BACK TO THE PLANET FROM WHICH THEY CAME.        ÁNOTHER TACTICAL HUMAN MOVE IS THE SENDING OF TRANSMISSIONS.  ÔHIS ALLOWS AN EMPIRE TO DIRECTLY SEND A LINE OF TEXT TO ANOTHER EMPIRE.  ÙOU CAN USE THIS COMMAND TO WARN POTENTIAL RIVALS, IRON OUT TREATIES, BLUFF ON YOUR ACTIONS, OR JUST SAY ‡HI‡ TO THE BUDDY YOU ARE TRYING TO DESTROY.  ÐART Ö:  ÎAKED AGGRESSION     ÓINCE THE WHOLE POINT OF THIS GAME IS THE ANNEXATION OF THE ENTIRE GALAXY, IT FOLLOWS THAT THE COMMAND YOU WILL TREASURE MOST IS THE ATTACKING MISSION.  ÔHIS INVOLVES SENDING A NUMBER OF SHIPS TO A PLANET WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS TO DEFEAT THE SHIPS ON THAT PLANET, AND FORCIBLY BRING THAT PLANET INTO YOUR EMPIRE.  ÄEFENSIVE PATROLS, TREATIES, AND TACTICS CAN ALL PLAY A PART IN BATTLE, BUT WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT, BRUTE FORCE WINS OUT.     ÙOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DEFENDING PLANET ALWAYS HAS A SLIGHT ADVANTAGE IN BATTLES, SO ALLOW FOR THIS WHEN DECIDING ON NUMBERS.  ÁLSO KEEP IN MIND THAT A CAPITOL PLANET IS THE HUB OF AN EMPIRE; DEFEATING THE CAPITOL PLANET WILL DISSOLVE THE EMPIRE.  ÁLSO NOTE THAT A BATTLE WITH A PLANET'S FORCES IS NOT ALWAYS TO THE DEATH; ONE SIDE WILL TEND TO SURRENDER WHEN OVERWHELMED IN NUMBERS.     ÌASTLY REMEMBER THAT ATTACKING A PLANET IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST WAY TO BE AGGRESSIVE.  ÓOMETIMES YOU MAY WANT TO SET UP A CONTAINMENT PATROL ON AN ENEMY WORLD.  ÔHIS IS USEFUL WHEN THE PLANET YOU WANT IS A LITTLE OUT OF REACH, BUT LEAVING HIM ALONE IS EVEN MORE OF A THREAT.ÐART ÖÉ:  ÏTHER COMMANDS     ÔHE REST OF THE COMMANDS ON THE MENU ARE PURELY INFORMATIONAL: LIST THE ACTIVE EMPIRES, VIEW THE BATTLE NEWS, RE-READ YOUR TRANSMISSIONS,LOOK AT THE GALACTIC CHART, SEE YOUR OWN EMPIRE'S STATS- ETC.     ÇALACTIC ÅMPIRE V2 IS ALSO EQUIPPED WITH A MAINTENANCE.  ÉF EXECUTED AS AN ONLINE BASIC MODULE DURING MONSTER MODE, IT WILL WEED OUT ALL EMPIRES WHO HAVE NOT MADE MOVES IN HALF A MONTH OR SO.  ÓTAYING UP ON YOUR PLANETS IS IMPERATIVE IN THIS GAME, SO YOU SHOULD PLAN TO PLAY VERY OFTEN TO HAVE ANY HOPES OF WINNING.ÐART ÖÉÉ:  ÉN ÃONCLUSION     ÉN A HIGH STRATEGY GAME LIKE THIS ONE A FEW SPECIAL TACTICS MAY MEAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SINKI
